This is the folder where you place an icon (*.png file format) with a small view/screenshoton your iconset. The current icon in this folder is only a placeholder. Your icon should have the same dimenesion.

Once you added your own icon you have to change the following tag/link inside the file description.xml, thus it points to your icon:

<icon>
    <default xlink:href="images/extensionicon_42.png" />
</icon>
