Please copy into this directory the autotext file that you created for your extension.

You need to create first a subdirectory for the target language of the autotext. E.g., if you
created an autotext file for German language create a subdirectory 'de'. You could create subdirectories
for every language you want to support with this extension. The paths.xcu of this template already support
such setting.
